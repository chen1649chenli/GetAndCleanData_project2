Here is how the scripts work:

1. Load test data file into a data frame
2. Load activity label of test data file into a data frame
3. Load subject id of test data file into a data frame
4. Load train data file into a data frame
5. Load activity label of train data file into a data frame
6. Load subject id of train data file into a data frame
7. Conbine test and train data frame - Step 1 in the assignment
8. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set - Step 3 in the assignment
9. Load complete measurement list
10. Extracts index of the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
11. Extracts only the measurements name list on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
12. Make the measurement anems for human readable
13. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement - Step 2 in the assignment
14. Add Subject and Activity Lable to the filtered data frame
15. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names - Step 4 in the assignment
16. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject - step 5
